### jshell

/list
    get list of history of executed statement

/var
    get a list of variable

System.out.print("Hello World);
    print hello world with jshell

can't replace " with '

Keywords
    A keywords is any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the java language

Variables
    Variables are a way to store information in our computer

### Data Type

int myFirstNumber = 5;
    set myFirstNumber as 5 using int data type

Declaration Statement
    A Declaration statement is ued to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, then optionally to set the variable to a specific value

Expression
    is a coding construct, that evaluates to a single value
    the code segnebt that is on the righr side of the equals sign in an assignmen or declaration statement

Operators
    perform an operation on a variable or value

Primitive Type:

    Whole  number
        byte
            -128 to 127
            8 bits
        short
            -32768 to 32787
            16 bits
        int 
            min value => Integer.MIN_VALUE; 
            max value => Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            32 bits
        long
            put L after the number
            long myLongValue = 100L;

            very big range
            64 bits

    Character
        Char
            Holds one, and only one, Character
            Literal enclosed in Single Quotes

            16 bits

        String
            Can hold multiple characters
            Literal enclosed in Double Quotes

            strings are immutable
                you can't change a string after it's created


    Real number
        float
            1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38

            32 bits

            On the other hand, the float data type can be specfifed as a numeric literal with a suffix of lowercase 'f', or uppercase 'F'
            This suffix is required if you are assigning a real number to a variable that was declared with a float type
        double
            4.9E-324 to 1.7976E308
            default type for any decimal or real number

            64 bits

            The double data type can be specified as numeric literal with a suffix of either lowercase "d" or uppercase "D"
            but doubles are the default in java, the suffix is optional to use.

    Boolean value
        boolean



Using the + sign in System.out.print
    The plus sign, +, when used in System.out.print will print different data types together as a single line of text.

Overflow
    if yoyu assign a numeric literal value to a data type that is outside of the range, the complier does give you an error.

Underscore
    int myMaxIntTest = 2_147_483_647;
    You can put the underscore anywhere you might want a comma, but you can't use an underscore at the start or end of the numeric literal.

### Casting
    byte myNewByteValue = (byte) (myMinByteValue / 2);

Floating Point Precision
    int
        5/2 = 2
        5/3 = 1
    float
        5f / 2f = 2.5
        5f / 3f = 1.6666666
    double
        5d / 2d = 2.5
        5d / 3d = 1.6666666666667

    double is more acturate

Why is the double a better choice in most circumstances?
    1. it's actually faster to process on many modern computer
        That's because computers have, at the chip level, the functionality to actually deal with these double numbers faster than the equivalent float

    2. The java libraries that we'll get into later in the course, particularly math functions, are often written to process doubles and not floats, and to return the rsult as double

    The creators of java selected the double because it's more precise and it can handle a larger range of numbers


String vs StringBuilder

    The String class is immutable, but can be used much like a primitive data type.

    The StringBuilder class is mutable, but does not share the String's special features, such as being able to to assign it a String literal or use the + operator on it

    Both are classes, but the String class is in a special category in the java language

    The String is so intrinsic to the Java language, it can be used like a 9th primitive type

    But it's not a primitive type at all, it's a class
    

### Operators, Operands and Expressions

    Operators in java are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two or three operands, and then return a result

    An operand is a term used to describe any object that is manipulated by an operator
        int myVar = 15 + 12;

        15 and 12 are operand

### Abbraviating Operators

result ++
    increase increment by 1

result += 1
    increase increment by 1, but can change it to any number

result --
    decrease increment by 1

result -= 1
    decrease increment by 1, but can change it to any number
