Java's code units

    writing code is similar to writing a document. It consists of special hierarchical units, which together form a whole.

    There are:
        The expression - An expression computes to a single value.

        The statement - statements are stand alone units of work.

        and Code Blocks - a code block is a set of zero, one, or more statements, usually grouped together in some way to achieve a single goal

Method
    A method decalres executable code tha can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arugments.

    A method is a way of reducing code duplication

Method Overloading
    Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods, with the same name, but the methods are declared with different parameters

    So you can execute a method with one name, but call it with different arugments.

    Java can resolve which method it needs to execute, based on the arguments being passed, when the method is invoked.

    The type, order and number of parameters, in conjuntion with the name, make a method signature unique

    A unique method signature is the key for the java complier, to determine if a method is overlaoded correctly.

    return type is not used to detemined method overloading
